# üåô Dark Mode - Quick Start Guide

## What Was Implemented

A complete dark mode toggle with three theme options:
- **Light** - Always light theme
- **Dark** - Always dark theme
- **System** - Follows your OS preference (default)

## How to Test

### 1. Start the App
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### 2. Find the Theme Toggle
Look for the **sun/moon icon button** in the top-right corner of the header (next to the user menu).

### 3. Try It Out
Click the button and select:
- "Dark" to switch to dark mode üåô
- "Light" to switch to light mode ‚òÄÔ∏è
- "System" to follow your OS setting üíª

## What to Look For

‚úÖ **It should work if:**
- The entire page changes color when you toggle
- Header, navigation, and content all switch themes
- Your selection persists when you refresh the page
- Cards and text remain readable in both themes

‚ùå **Report an issue if:**
- Theme doesn't change when clicking toggle
- Some parts of the page stay light/dark
- Theme doesn't persist after refresh
- Text is hard to read in one of the themes

## Files Created

1. **ThemeContext.tsx** - Manages theme state
2. **ThemeToggle.tsx** - The sun/moon button component
3. **ThemeScript.tsx** - Prevents flash on page load

## Technical Details

- Uses shadcn/ui components
- Tailwind CSS v4 with semantic color tokens

- No flash of unstyled content (FOUC)
