# üöÄ Production Deployment Checklist

Use this checklist to ensure all steps are completed for production deployment.

---

## Pre-Deployment

- [ ] Read [docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) completely
- [ ] Ensure code is pushed to GitHub repository
- [ ] Verify `.env` files are in `.gitignore` (not committed)
- [ ] Have FMP API key ready

---

## Step 1: Generate Secrets (5 minutes)

- [ ] Run: `node scripts/generate-secrets.js`
- [ ] Save JWT_SECRET (64 chars)
- [ ] Save NEXTAUTH_SECRET (64 chars)
- [ ] Save ADMIN_API_KEY (optional, 64 chars)

---

## Step 2: Database Setup - Neon (15 minutes)

- [ ] Sign up at [neon.tech](https://neon.tech) with GitHub
- [ ] Create project: "congresstracker"
- [ ] Choose region closest to you
- [ ] Copy PostgreSQL connection string
- [ ] Save connection string securely
- [ ] **Note:** Migrations run automatically on backend startup (no manual psql needed)
- [ ] ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Neon free tier databases sleep after inactivity and can take 5-15 seconds to wake up

---

## Step 3: Redis Setup - Upstash (10 minutes)

- [ ] Sign up at [upstash.com](https://upstash.com) with GitHub
- [ ] Create Redis database: "congresstracker-cache"
- [ ] Type: Regional
- [ ] Choose same region as Neon
- [ ] Copy Redis connection string
- [ ] Save connection string securely
- [ ] (Optional) Test: `redis-cli -u "<connection-string>" PING`

---

## Step 4: Backend Deployment - Render (20 minutes)

- [ ] Sign up at [render.com](https://render.com) with GitHub
- [ ] Click "New +" ‚Üí "Web Service"
- [ ] Connect repository: `shaunleeweirong/congresstracker`
- [ ] Name: `congresstracker-backend`
- [ ] Region: Same as Neon/Upstash
- [ ] Branch: `master`
- [ ] Root Directory: `backend`
- [ ] Build: `npm install && npm run build`
- [ ] Start: `npm start`
- [ ] Plan: **Free**
- [ ] Health Check Path: `/health`

### Environment Variables:
- [ ] `NODE_ENV` = `production`
- [ ] `PORT` = `3001`
- [ ] `DATABASE_URL` = (from Neon)
- [ ] `REDIS_URL` = (from Upstash)
- [ ] `JWT_SECRET` = (from Step 1)
- [ ] `FMP_API_KEY` = (your FMP key)
- [ ] `CORS_ORIGIN` = `https://localhost:3000` (placeholder, will update)
- [ ] `JWT_EXPIRES_IN` = `7d`
- [ ] `BCRYPT_ROUNDS` = `12`
- [ ] `API_VERSION` = `v1`
- [ ] `LOG_LEVEL` = `info`

### After Deployment:
- [ ] Wait for build to complete (~5-10 min)
- [ ] **Watch deployment logs for these success indicators:**
  - [ ] ‚úÖ `Creating migrations table succeeded (took ~1800ms)`
  - [ ] ‚úÖ `Fetching executed migrations succeeded (took ~200ms)`
  - [ ] ‚úÖ `No pending migrations`
  - [ ] ‚úÖ `üöÄ Server running on port 3001`
  - [ ] ‚úÖ `Your service is live üéâ`
- [ ] Copy backend URL (e.g., `https://congresstracker-backend.onrender.com`)
- [ ] Test health: `curl https://your-backend.onrender.com/health`
- [ ] Should return: `{"status":"healthy","timestamp":"...","uptime":...,"version":"1.0.0"}`
- [ ] ‚ö†Ô∏è **If deployment fails with "Connection terminated due to connection timeout":**
  - This means Neon took too long to wake up (rare but possible)
  - Simply trigger "Manual Deploy" ‚Üí "Deploy latest commit" to retry
  - The retry logic will handle it (up to 5 attempts with exponential backoff)

---

## Step 5: Initial Data Sync (15 minutes)

- [ ] Go to Render dashboard ‚Üí congresstracker-backend
- [ ] Click "Shell" tab
- [ ] Wait for shell to connect
- [ ] Run: `npm run sync:now`

## Troubleshooting

If something doesn't work, check:

1. **Render logs** (Dashboard ‚Üí Logs tab)
2. **Vercel deployment logs** (Deployments ‚Üí View build logs)
3. **Browser console** (F12 ‚Üí Console tab)
4. **GitHub Actions logs** (Actions tab ‚Üí Click workflow run)
5. [docs/DEPLOYMENT.md#troubleshooting](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md#troubleshooting)

### Common Issues & Solutions:

#### ‚ùå "Connection terminated due to connection timeout" during deployment
**Cause:** Neon database took longer than 15 seconds to wake from sleep (rare on free tier)

**Solution:**
1. Go to Render dashboard ‚Üí Your service
2. Click "Manual Deploy" ‚Üí "Deploy latest commit"
3. Watch logs - the retry logic (5 attempts) should handle it
4. If still failing after 3 manual deploys, check your `DATABASE_URL` is correct

#### ‚ùå "Migration failed" or "server cannot start safely"
**Cause:** Database connection issues or invalid migration SQL

**Solution:**
1. Verify `DATABASE_URL` environment variable is correct in Render
2. Test connection: `psql "<your-database-url>" -c "SELECT 1"`
3. Check Neon dashboard - database should be active (green)
4. Trigger manual deploy after confirming DATABASE_URL

#### ‚ùå Deployment shows "Live" but health endpoint returns 502
**Cause:** Server crashed after startup or build output is incorrect

**Solution:**
1. Check Render logs for error messages after "Server running on port 3001"
2. Verify build command is: `npm install && npm run build`
3. Verify start command is: `npm start`
4. Check that `dist/server.js` exists in build output

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è "ChangeWarning: The onLimitReached configuration option is deprecated"
**Cause:** Old express-rate-limit configuration (already fixed in latest code)

**Solution:** This is just a warning and won't break anything. Update to latest code:
```bash
git pull origin master
```

#### üêå Slow first request (15-30 seconds)
**Cause:** Render free tier spins down after 15 minutes of inactivity

**Solution:**
1. This is expected behavior on free tier
2. Set up UptimeRobot (Step 9) to ping every 5 minutes
3. Or upgrade to Render paid plan ($7/month for always-on)
