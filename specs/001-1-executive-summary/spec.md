# Feature Specification: Congressional Trading Transparency Platform

**Feature Branch**: `001-1-executive-summary`  
**Created**: 2025-09-24  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
What
A web-based transparency platform that aggregates and displays real-time stock trading data from congressional members (House and Senate) and corporate insiders, providing users with searchable feeds, alerts, and analytics tools to track "smart money" movements.
Why
Current solutions for tracking political and insider trades are fragmented, delayed, and inaccessible to retail investors. By centralizing this data with modern UX, we democratize access to trading intelligence that was previously available only to institutional investors, while promoting government transparency and informed investment decisions.
Product Vision
Create a transparency platform that provides real-time visibility into stock trades made by congressional members and corporate insiders, enabling users to track "smart money" movements and make informed investment decisions.
Product Mission
Democratize access to trading data from politicians and corporate executives, promoting transparency and providing retail investors with insights previously available only to institutional players."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
An investor wants to track stock trading activities of congressional members and corporate insiders to identify investment opportunities. They visit the platform, search for specific politicians or companies, view recent trading activities in an organized feed, and set up alerts for future trades by specific individuals or involving specific stocks.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user visits the platform, **When** they search for a specific congressional member by name, **Then** they see a chronological list of that person's recent stock trades with transaction details
2. **Given** a user is viewing trading data, **When** they click on a specific stock ticker, **Then** they see all congressional and insider trades for that stock across all tracked individuals
3. **Given** a user wants to track future activity, **When** they create an alert for a specific politician or stock, **Then** they receive notifications when new trading activity matches their criteria
4. **Given** a user browses the main feed, **When** they apply filters for date range or transaction type, **Then** the feed updates to show only trades matching their filter criteria

### Edge Cases
- What happens when trading data is delayed or temporarily unavailable?
- How does the system handle incomplete or erroneous trading disclosures?
- What occurs when a user searches for individuals with no trading activity?
- How are duplicate or amended trading disclosures managed?
